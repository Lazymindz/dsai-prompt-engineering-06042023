## Prompt Engineering Primer

For eveone who attended the [talk](https://www.meetup.com/nottingham-artificial-intelligence-meetup/events/kqlcctyfcgbjb/) on Prompt Engineering on 06/04/2023, the slides of the meetup are [here](https://github.com/Lazymindz/dsai-prompt-engineering-06042023)

Prompt Engineering is a fascinating and emerging field that leverages natural language to interact with artificial intelligence models. It has many applications and benefits for both technical and non-technical users, such as improving model performance, reducing data and compute requirements, and enhancing user experience.

If you are interested in learning more about Prompt Engineering, I highly recommend you to check out the original work of Elvis Saravia

The talk itself is based on the amazing work of Elvis Saravia. I have only localised the content for Nottingham audience, and for a mix of Techincal/Non-Technical group.
